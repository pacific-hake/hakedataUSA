#' Find the working directory for `hake-assessment`
#'
#' Find the directory called `hake-assessment/data`, which should be a clone of
#' \url{www.github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment}. The location of the
#' directory is found based on a set of rules for a given system and user name
#' of the computer you are on. This `data` directory stores non-confidential
#' data used in the assessment of Pacific Hake and is integral in building the
#' bridging files to go from one year of data to the next. If the combination
#' of known system and user names are not found then it will default to using
#' your current working directory.
#'
#' @return A string specifying the full file path for the
#' `hake-assessment/data` directory. The default is your current working
#' directory.

#' Find last year of data for current assessment
#'
#' Data is extracted the first Friday in January of the year
#' following the last year of data. Therefore, if data are extracted
#' from the databases in January, February, or March, then the terminal
#' year of data should be the previous year. Else, one would want the
#' most recent data in the current year as the last year of data included
#' in the extraction.

#' Find username and passwords for databases
#'
#' Find the username and passwords specific given the username of the computer
#' and stored or entered passwords for accessing databases that store
#' confidential information about landings of Pacific Hake.
#'
#' @param database A vector of character values specifying which databases you
#'   want login information for.
#' @param file A file path specifying where to find the passwords.
#'   The path can be full or relative to your current working directory.
#'   If a path is provided, the file that it leads to
#'   must be for a text file with one password per line for each database
#'   in the `database` argument and in that order.
#'   The default for `database` means that the file would have two lines,
#'   where the first line is the NORPAC password and
#'   the second line is the PacFIN password.
#'   These passwords should not be surrounded with quotes.
#'   If a file name is not provided, which is the default behaviour, then
#'   the user will be prompted for their passwords. This also happens if
#'   the file cannot be found given the path provided.
#'
#' @return A list with two entries, `usernames` and `passwords`.
#' Each element will have the same number of entries as the
#' input argument `database` and be named using the elements of `database`.
#' The list is invisibly returned to ensure that the passwords are not printed
#' to the screen. Thus, the function call should be assigned to an object.
