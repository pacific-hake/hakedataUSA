#' Calculate ageing error matrix
#'
#' Ageing error for Pacific Hake is based on
#' an overall ageing error for each mean age and
#' a multiplier to decrease ageing error for strong cohorts.
#' If you were to plot ageing error, you could see diagonal patterns
#' for cohorts that are moving through the population.
#' This necessitates an ageing error that is specific to
#' each year of data since 1975, i.e., the first year of fishery ages.
#'
#' @return A 2 x 21 matrix is returned with column names.
#' The rationale for the number of columns comes from the
#' number of population age bins plus one because age-0 fish
#' have an ageing error assigned to them as well.
#' The first row is the mean age and
#' the second row is the standard deviation based on a normal distribution.
#' Mean age will be different from 0.5 + age if there is bias.
#' Standard deviation will be different than zero if there imprecision.
#'
#' @param ages The ages that have strong cohorts and decreased ageing error.
#' Note that this should be the age-bin not the mean age in the first row of
#' the returned matrix.
#' @param x A vector of ageing error used for each definition of ageing
#' error in the stock assessment model.
#' @param multiplier A single value that is multiplied times certain
#' entries of \code{x} to account for cohort effects. The default for Pacific
#' Hake is 0.55.
