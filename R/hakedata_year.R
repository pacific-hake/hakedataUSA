#' Find last year of data for current assessment
#'
#' Data is extracted the first Friday in January of the year
#' following the last year of data. Therefore, if data are extracted
#' from the databases in January, February, or March, then the terminal
#' year of data should be the previous year. Else, one would want the
#' most recent data in the current year as the last year of data included
#' in the extraction.
